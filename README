Simple HTTP 1.1 Web Server implementation as a college "Network architecture" assigment.

Server is realized as single thread process: accept request, handle request, send response.

A client connect with the separate thread. A server side keeps all threads in thread pool.

All incoming request are accepting with the 8888 port. To shutdown the server is dedicated 9999 port.
Shutdown server method is realized as separate thread which always waits for the request.

The first server version implements GET and HEAD commands and have nice extension capabilities, 
having the easy understandable architecture.

All events from/to server are logging to the file.
